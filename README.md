# Milestone 3
Please note that Milestones 1 and 2 involved setting up the environment and getting familiar with the overall scope of the project. Milestone 3 involved: 

1. Writing a series of simple functions in `tabular_data.py` file to load in the airbnb data from a csv file, carry out cleaning operations on the data and then save them to another csv.file. 
2. Another function `load_airbnb` loads numeric columns of this dataset as pandas dataframe `features` and price per night column as `labels` in preparation for data analysis.
